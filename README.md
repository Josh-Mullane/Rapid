Rapid Readme

This repo contains my four Rapid Games Prototyping projects. Below will be a brief summary of each of them, with their core mechanics and
controls.

proj1 - marble madness

The marble madness file contains the first rapid games prototyping project. It is a game in which a marble rolls through a level
to reach a goal. To play, use WASD to move the ball.

proj2 - 2d sidescroller

The side scroller file contains the second rapid games prototyping project. In this game, using the WASD + M1 keys and button, 
the player wasp flies about shooting enemies. The enemies are then deleted, the player has a healthbar which can track 
how near death they are

proj3 - 2d platformer

the 2d platformer file contains the third rapid games prototyping project. In this game, the WASD keys can once again be used to move around, 
as well as the shift key for a dash. The jump key can be used twice for a double jump. To kill the bob the blob enemy, jump atop it.
Otherwise contact with bob is deadly to the player.

proj4 - top down shooter

the top down shooter file contains the fourth and final rapid games prototyping project. In this game, WASD to move and M1 to fire once again
but the projectile will not fire like in proj2. This projectile must be kicked into the enemies in order to kill them.
The taco turtle enemies, rather than kill the player, close the game all together.
